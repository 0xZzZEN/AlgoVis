An interactive, cross-platform algorithm visualizer built with C and raylib. Explore a combination of logic, entertainment and art

Educational project to understand how raylib works..
Work In Progress

Goal is to render <b>sorting algorithms</b> on the screen and trace them without any prior knowledge about SDL/OpenGL

# A concept art from PlayState


# Program states
<br>StartState - a starting state after execution. The croupier appearance 

<br><br>MenuState - a selection option for choosing data structures, particular algorithm, etc <br>

<br><br>LoadingStatem - transit between MenuState to the RandomState <br>

<br><br>RandomState - random event 33%, happening in the LoadingState <br>

<br><br>PlayState - visualization of the particular algorithm, with step by step approach <br>
