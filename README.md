An interactive, cross-platform algorithm visualizer built with C and raylib. Explore a combination of logic, entertainment and art

Educational project to understand how raylib works..
Work In Progress

Goal is to render <b>sorting algorithms</b> on the screen and trace them without any prior knowledge about SDL/OpenGL

# A concept art from PlayState


# Program states
<p>StartState - a starting state after execution. The croupier appearance </p>

<p>MenuState - a selection option for choosing data structures, particular algorithm, etc </p>

<p>LoadingStatem - transit between MenuState to the RandomState </p>

<p>RandomState - random event 33%, happening in the LoadingState </p>

<p>PlayState - visualization of the particular algorithm, with step by step approach </p>
