An interactive, cross-platform algorithm visualizer built with C and raylib. Explore a combination of logic, entertainment and art

Educational project to understand how raylib works..
Work In Progress

Goal is to render <b>sorting algorithms</b> on the screen and trace them without any prior knowledge about SDL/OpenGL

# Program states
<br>StartState - a starting state after execution. The croupier appearance 
<br>MenuState - a selection option for choosing data structures, particular algorithm, etc
<br>LoadingState - transition from the MenuState to the PlayState
<br>RandomState - a random event with a 33% chance, happening in the LoadingState
<br>PlayState - a visualization of the particular algorithm, with step by step approach

# Transition map
